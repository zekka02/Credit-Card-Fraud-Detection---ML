Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project applies machine learning models to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset. The data was highly imbalanced, so I used undersampling to balance it before training.

Models Tested
Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Shallow Neural Network

Key Result
After balancing the data, SVM achieved the best performance with high precision (0.97) and F1-score (0.93) for the fraud class. The shallow neural net performed similarly but slightly behind.

Tools
Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib)
