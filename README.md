Credit Card Fraud Detection â€“ Machine Learning Project
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using supervised machine learning techniques. The dataset is imbalanced, so various models were trained and compared using balanced data (via undersampling).

Models tested:

Logistic Regression

Shallow Neural Network

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting Classifier

After evaluating precision, recall, F1-score, and overall accuracy, SVM was selected as the final model due to its strong balance between fraud detection accuracy and low false positives.

Key features:

Balanced binary classification

Model performance evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score

Final model: Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Implemented using Python (scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib)
